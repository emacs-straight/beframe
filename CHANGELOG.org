* 0.2.0

There were no release notes for the initial version of Beframe.  Watch
the video demo I produced on 2023-02-28 to get an overview of what
this package is all about:

In short: beframe your buffers, not your outlook.  Oops that is for
the philosophy blog! ðŸ™ƒ

** A beframed buffer menu

The command ~beframe-buffer-menu~ produces a dedicated buffer with a
list of buffers for the current frame.  This is the counterpart of
~beframe-switch-buffer~.  When called with a prefix argument (=C-u=
with default key bindings), it prompts for a frame whose buffers it
will display.

** Frame-specific scratch buffer

The user option ~beframe-create-frame-scratch-buffer~ allows
~beframe-mode~ to create a frame-specific scratch buffer that runs the
~initial-major-mode~.  This is done upon the creation of a new frame
and the scratch buffer is named after the frame it belongs to.  For
example, if the frame is called =modus-themes=, the corresponding
scratch buffer is =*scratch for modus-themes*=.  Set this user option
to ~nil~ to disable the creation of such scratch buffers.

The user option ~beframe-kill-frame-scratch-buffer~ is the counterpart
of ~beframe-create-frame-scratch-buffer~.  It kills the frame-specific
scratch buffer after the frame is deleted.  Set this user option to
~nil~ to disable the killing of such buffers.

** Assuming and unassuming buffers

Beframe makes it possible to add or remove buffers from the list of
buffers associated with the current frame.  This provides for a
flexible workflow where buffers can be initially beframed yet
consolidated into new lists on demand.

*** Assuming buffers

To assume buffers is to include them in the buffer list associated
with the current frame.

- The command ~beframe-assume-frame-buffers~ (alias
  ~beframe-add-frame-buffers~) prompts for a frame and then copies its
  buffer list into the current frame.

- The command ~beframe-assume-buffers~ (alias ~beframe-add-buffers~)
  adds buffers from a given frame to the current frame.  In
  interactive use, the command first prompts for a frame and then asks
  about the list of buffers therein.  The to-be-assumed buffer list is
  compiled with ~completing-read-multiple~.  This means that the user
  can select multiple buffers, each separated by the ~crm-separator~
  (typically a comma).

- The command ~beframe-assume-buffers-all-frames~ prompts with
  minibuffer completion for a list of buffers to assume.  The
  interface is the same as that of ~beframe-assume-buffers~ except
  that there is no prompt for a frame: buffers belong to the
  consolidated buffer list (all frames).

- The command ~beframe-assume-all-buffers-no-prompts~ unconditionally
  assumes the consolidated buffer list.

*** Unassuming buffers

To unassume buffers is to omit them from the buffer list associated with
the current frame.

- The command ~beframe-unassume-frame-buffers~ (alias
  ~beframe-remove-frame-buffers~) prompts for a frame and then removes
  its buffer list from the current frame.

- The command ~beframe-unassume-buffers~ (alias
  ~beframe-remove-buffers~) removes buffers from the current frame.
  In interactive use, the to-be-unassumed buffer list is compiled with
  ~completing-read-multiple~.  This means that the user can select
  multiple buffers, each separated by the ~crm-separator~ (typically a
  comma).

- The command ~beframe-unassume-all-buffers-no-prompts~ unconditionally
  unassumes the consolidated buffer list, but preserves the list
  stored in the user option ~beframe-global-buffers~.

  Add the ability to sort the buffer list

  Some completion libraries, like consult, give the user the option to
  sort the list of buffers according to some strategy.  For example,
  sorting by visibilityâ€”in the sense that one is first shown hidden
  buffers, then visible ones, and only then the current bufferâ€”may be
  preferrable when deciding to switch buffers via consult-buffer.

  Since beframe.el can be used as a consult source (see the manual),
  endowing beframe--buffer-list with an arbitrary sort function greatly
  improves the synergy between the two libraries.

The manual explains how this works in practice:

Thanks to Tony Zorman for including the reference to the sorting mechanism!
